# Books_Store
A book store website is an online platform where users can browse and purchase books from a catalog of available titles. 
Typically, book store websites will have a search function, allowing users to find books by title, author, or 
keyword, as well as a section for new releases and bestsellers. Users may also be able to browse books by genre or category.
